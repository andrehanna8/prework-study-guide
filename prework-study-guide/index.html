        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is used to give webpage content a structure</p>
          <p>There are multiple elements or "tags" that are used to make up this structure such as:</p>
          <li>The head element which contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element which contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The title element which defines the title for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The style element which defines CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element which defines the base URL for the webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element which connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element which defines metadata such as the character set, description keywords, author and viewport.</li>
          <li>The script element which embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The viewport element which sets the default view for our webpage.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <p>Here are some Git commands to start off:</p>
          <li>‘pwd’- displays current working directory</li>
          <li>‘ls’ - displays list of files and folders in the current directory</li>
          <li>‘cd’ - navigates between directories in the path</li>
          <li>‘cd ..” navigates backwards, one level at a time, through the path of your directories</li>
          <li>‘mkdir’ - creates a new directory</li>
          <li>‘touch’ - creates a file inside a directory</li>
          <li>“start” - opens a file</li>
          <p>Here is some important vocabulary:</p>
          <li>“Repo” - every project on github is called this - a folder for your project that contains all of the files and their revision history</li>
          <li>“Branch” - workspace where you can make changes that don't affect the live site. Create a new branch for your work, and name it to best describe work </li>
          <li> “Markdown or (.md) - the way content files are formatted in github  -  A way to write for the web using plain text </li>
          <li>“Commit changes” - saving a new version of a file you’re working on, adds changes to your branch</li>
          <li>“Pull Request (PR) - asking for changes on a branch to merge into another branch.  Way to discuss and review work with others </li>
          <li>“Merge” - when a PR is approved and changes are “pulled in” or merged into main branch. Changes publish to live site </li>
          <li>“Issue” - way to report new tasks or content fixes or track progress on project board.  Open an issue for a new task and close once done </li>
          <li>Feature Branch - Holds code that is currently being developed for a single feature of the application. Is also called a “working branch”</li>
          <li>Develop Branch - Can hold the code for multiple feature branches that havent been merged into the main branch yet. Working branches can be kept
              up to date with the code in the main branch but the additions and changes in the working branches do not affect the final product until they are approved and reviewed.</li>
